Problem statement
Today's fashion industry aims to cater to GenZ consumers, but a more nuanced approach is necessary to truly attract them. Despite efforts to provide popular and trendy recommendations, there remains a lack of personalization that aligns with each customer's unique style and complements their features. As a result, customers may purchase trendy products only to find out that they do not suit them.
This might cause a return of products and higher returns lead to an unsustainable environment.
Solutions
Interactive User Profile Setup:
Implement an interactive user profile setup that collects detailed information about each customer’s preferences, style, and body features. This allows the system to understand individual tastes and provide more tailored recommendations.

Engaging Style Questionnaire:
Design an engaging style questionnaire that helps customers define their fashion sense. Questions can range from preferred colors and patterns to favorite fashion icons, ensuring a deeper understanding of each user’s unique style.

Data Analysis and Trend Tracking:
Utilize advanced data analysis and trend tracking tools to monitor evolving fashion trends and consumer preferences. By continuously updating the system with the latest trends and customer data, the recommendations remain current and relevant.

Customized Outfit Recommendations:
Generate customized outfit recommendations that are specifically curated to match the user's profile and questionnaire responses. This personalized approach ensures that the suggested outfits not only follow the latest trends but also complement the user’s individual style and features, reducing the likelihood of returns and promoting sustainability.
